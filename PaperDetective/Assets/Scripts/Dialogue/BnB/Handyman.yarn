    Handyman: Hello!
    You: Hi, do you know where the key to the room with the music is?
    Handyman: Sorry, I don’t know where it might be. 
    Handyman: But hey, if you need something to deal with the music, I’m happy to help.
    Handyman: Here, you can have some of my equipment if you need it.
    You: I’ll take that screwdriver off your hands, then.
    Handyman: Sure thing! Good luck!

    Handyman: I see that screwdriver was helpful after all!
    You: Yeah thanks for the assist! While you’re here, do you happen to know where the guy from that room might be?

        Handyman: Ah, I’m just about wrapped up here. Is there anything you need?
        You: Yes, someone said there was a noise coming from the basement. Do you have a way in there?
        Handyman: Ah, yes, I actually have that key with me! I’ll lend it to you if you promise to give it back when you’re done.
        You: Thank you, I’ll be right back then.
