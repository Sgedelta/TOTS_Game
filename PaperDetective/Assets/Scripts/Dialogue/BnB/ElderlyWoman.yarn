//Play this chunk if this is the first time the player interacts with this NPC.
<<once>>
    Woman: Oh, hello! Will you be staying with us tonight?
    You: Yes, please, I just need a place to stay tonight and I’ll be out of your hair. My name is Jeff.
    Woman: Jeff?! Oh, dear goodness, I had no idea such a famous international detective was here tonight!
    You: No, I’m afraid that name is just a coincidence.
    Woman: Oh, there’s no need to worry, I’m a big fan of police stories and such, I’ve heard so much about you!
    Woman: Say, could I ask you to do something for me? 
    Woman: My son has been holed up in his room, and his music is disturbing some of the guests. We’ve tried knocking on the door, but he just won’t answer. 
    Woman: We used to have a key around here, but it appears to have run off somewhere. Would you be so kind as to find it and ask my son to turn down the music?
    Woman: It should be a trivial task for a detective of your caliber, and you can have a room for free in return.
    You: …I guess I have enough time to look into it.
    Woman: Oh, that’s so good to hear! See if the handyman can help you at all. My son’s room is the first door after you get up the stairs

    <<once>>
    You: Hello, ma’am. I got into the room to turn off the music, but your son wasn’t there.
    Woman: Really? Oh, dear, where could he be?
    You: Do you have any ideas?
    Woman: No, he would’ve said something if he left…
    Woman: Please, dear, I hate to ask this, but could you find my son? I worry for his safety, especially with all the recent talk of murders.
    Woman: I’ll throw in a free breakfast on top of your room if you find him.

    //Add note for player to find the son.

    Woman: Have you found my son yet?
    You: No, I’m still looking at the moment. I’ll let you know when I find him.
    Woman: Dear, oh dear, where could he be?
